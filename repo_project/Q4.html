        It removes the monotony of life. There are many kinds of holidays. 
        They are weekly, yearly, religious and seasonal holidays.
        Generally, we pass a holiday doing the household chores, arranging various food items, going for shopping. Besides, we also enjoy our holiday reading novels,
        listening songs, painting and gossiping with our family members or friends. I live in Dhaka with my family. On the holiday, we often go to different places like National Zoo at Mirpur, 
        National Museum at Shahbag, Lalbag Killa, Ahsan Monjil, Dhaka Medical College, Salimullah Muslim Hall and University of Dhaka etc.
        Some special programmes are also taken on that day. We invite our relatives or friends and we prepare various foods. 
        However, we eagerly wait for holiday. Our joys know no bound on holiday.
        Without it, life would have been dull and meaningless.

        We may be able to have a hundred or a thousand friends, or even more. But there is only one friend who really has loyalty on you if you really think about it,
        that is best friend. My best friend is my best partner for living my life. His name is Sugeng Gunawan, and I used to call him Sugeng. He is someone who really knows me deeply.
        He knows the characteristic of me, from the outside and even inside of me. Someone who is able to feel my mood. He knows when I feel happy and when I feel very sad.
        He is also sad when I look sad, and he is also happy when I feel happy. Someone who knows how to respond any kind of my mood,
        he knows how to comfort me</p>

        <p class="italic"><a name="Oranges"><strong>Oranges</strong></a><br><br>An orange is a type of citrus fruit which people often eat. Oranges are a very good source of vitamins, especially vitamin C.
        Orange juice is an important part of many people's breakfast. The "sweet orange", which is the kind that are most often eaten today, grew first in Asia but now grows in many parts of the world.
        Oranges are round orange-coloured fruit that grow on a tree which can reach 10 metres (33 ft) high. Orange trees have dark green shiny leaves and small white flowers with five petals.
        The flowers smell very sweet which attracts many bees.An orange has a tough shiny orange skin. Inside, the fruit is divided into "segments", which have thin tough skins that hold together many little sections with juice inside.
        There are usually ten segments in an orange, but sometimes there are more. Inside each segment of most types of orange there are seeds called "pips".

        <p class="italic"><a name="Apples"><strong>Apples</strong></a><br><br>The apple tree (Malus pumila, commonly and erroneously called Malus domestica) is a deciduous tree in the rose family best known for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple.
        It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.
        Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, 
        including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions. Apple trees are large if grown from seed. Generally apple cultivars are propagated by grafting onto rootstocks, which control the size of the resulting tree

        <p class="italic"><a name="Strawberry"><strong>Strawberry</strong></a><br><br>The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria (collectively known as the strawberries). It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit.
        The fruit (which is not a botanical berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit) is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, 
        either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, fruit juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers,
        perfume, and many others The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714. 
        Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.

        <p class="italic"><a name="Blueberry"><strong>Blueberry</strong></a><br><br>are perennial flowering plants with indigo-colored berries from the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium (a genus that also includes cranberries, bilberries and grouseberries).
        Species in the section Cyanococcus are the most common fruits sold as "blueberries" and are native to North America (commercially cultivated highbush blueberries were not introduced into Europe until the 1930s).
        Blueberries are usually erect, prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (3.9 in) to 4 meters (13 ft) in height. In the commercial production of blueberries, the smaller species are known as "lowbush blueberries" (synonymous with "wild"),
        while the larger species are known as "highbush blueberries".
        The leaves can be either deciduous or evergreen, ovate to lanceolate, and 1–8 cm (0.39–3.15 in) long and 0.5–3.5 cm (0.20–1.38 in) broad.
        The flowers are bell-shaped, white, pale pink or red, sometimes tinged greenish.

        <p class="italic"><a name="Grapes"><strong>Grapes</strong></a><br><br>Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. "White" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape.
        Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes. Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are
        responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines. Grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape resembling a prolate spheroid
